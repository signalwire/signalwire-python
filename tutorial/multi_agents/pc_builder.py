PC Builder Demo Service - Multiple Agent Architecture

This service provides specialized PC building assistance through three dedicated agents:
- Triage Agent (/) - Routes customers to appropriate specialists
- Sales Agent (/sales) - Handles product recommendations and purchases  
- Support Agent (/support) - Provides technical support and troubleshooting

Key Feature: Uses SignalWire's swml_transfer skill with required_fields for automatic
context preservation. The skill ensures both the customer's name and a comprehensive summary
are collected before transferring and makes them available via ${call_data.user_name}
and ${call_data.summary} to the receiving agent.
