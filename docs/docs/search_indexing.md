## Building Indexes

Search indexes are SQLite databases with the `.swsearch` extension that contain processed documents, embeddings, and search metadata. Indexes can also be stored in PostgreSQL via the pgvector backend.

### CLI Quick Start (sw-search)

The `sw-search` command-line tool is the primary interface for building, searching, validating, and migrating indexes.

**Single directory:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs --output knowledge.swsearch
```

**Multiple directories:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs ./examples ./tutorials --output knowledge.swsearch
```

**Specific files:**

```bash
sw-search README.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/api.md --output knowledge.swsearch
```

**Mixed (directories and files):**

```bash
sw-search ./docs README.md ./examples/agent.py --output knowledge.swsearch
```

**Build from the comprehensive concepts guide:**

```bash
sw-search docs/agent_guide.md --output concepts.swsearch
```

**Full configuration example:**

```bash
sw-search docs/agent_guide.md ./examples README.md \
    --output ./knowledge.swsearch \
    --chunking-strategy sentence \
    --max-sentences-per-chunk 8 \
    --file-types md,txt,rst,py \
    --exclude "**/test/**,**/__pycache__/**" \
    --model mini \
    --tags documentation,api \
    --verbose
```

**Build to pgvector:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --backend pgvector \
  --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db" \
  --output docs_collection \
  --chunking-strategy markdown
```

With pgvector, `--output` specifies the collection name, not a filename.

### Python API (IndexBuilder)

```python
from signalwire.search import IndexBuilder

# Create index builder
builder = IndexBuilder(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
    chunk_size=500,
    chunk_overlap=50,
    verbose=True
)

# Build index
builder.build_index(
    source_dir="./docs",
    output_file="docs.swsearch",
    file_types=["md", "txt"],
    exclude_patterns=["**/test/**"],
    tags=["documentation"]
)
```

### Output Formats (.swsearch)

Each `.swsearch` file is a SQLite database containing:

- **Document chunks** with embeddings and metadata
- **Full-text search index** (SQLite FTS5)
- **Configuration** and model information
- **Synonym cache** for query expansion

The index can be distributed as a single portable file. For production multi-agent deployments, the pgvector backend provides concurrent access and real-time updates.

## Chunking Strategies

Before content can be searched, it must be broken into chunks. The chunking strategy has a significant impact on search quality. Each chunk should ideally be a self-contained unit that answers a question or explains a concept.

**Chunk size trade-offs:**

- **Small chunks:** More precise matching, less noise in results, but may lack context and can split related information.
- **Large chunks:** More context, keeps related information together, but less precise matching and more noise in results.

### Overview of All Strategies

The SDK provides nine chunking strategies, each optimized for different content types.

**1. Sentence-Based (Default)**

Groups sentences together, splitting at natural sentence boundaries.

```bash
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy sentence --max-sentences-per-chunk 5
```

Parameters:

- `max-sentences-per-chunk`: Number of sentences per chunk (default: 5)
- `split-newlines`: Minimum newlines to force a split (default: 2)

Best for general documentation, blog posts, plain text, and as a default starting point.

**2. Paragraph**

Splits at paragraph boundaries (double newlines).

```bash
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy paragraph
```

Best for content with clear paragraph structure and markdown files with distinct sections. Avoid for dense text with very long paragraphs.

**3. Page**

Splits documents at page boundaries.

```bash
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy page --file-types pdf
```

Best for PDF documents, presentations, and reports with page-level organization. Not applicable to web content or markdown.

**4. Sliding Window**

Creates overlapping chunks by sliding a window across the text.

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy sliding \
  --chunk-size 100 \
  --overlap-size 20
```

Parameters:

- `chunk-size`: Words per chunk
- `overlap-size`: Words that overlap between chunks

Best for ensuring context is not lost at chunk boundaries and for dense technical content. Trade-off: produces more chunks (larger index) due to overlap.

Example:

```
Text: "A B C D E F G H I J"
Chunk size: 5, Overlap: 2

Chunk 1: A B C D E
Chunk 2:     D E F G H
Chunk 3:         G H I J
```

**5. Semantic**

Groups sentences with similar embeddings together.

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy semantic \
  --semantic-threshold 0.6
```

Parameters:

- `semantic-threshold`: Similarity threshold for grouping (0.0-1.0)

Best for content that naturally clusters by topic and long documents with shifting topics. Avoid for short documents or already well-structured content.

**6. Topic**

Detects topic changes and splits at those boundaries.

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy topic \
  --topic-threshold 0.2
```

Parameters:

- `topic-threshold`: Sensitivity to topic changes (lower = more splits)

Best for long-form content covering multiple topics, articles, and meeting transcripts. Avoid for focused documents on a single topic.

**7. QA-Optimized**

Optimized for question-answering; preserves questions with their answers.

```bash
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy qa
```

Features:

- Detects question patterns (what, how, why, etc.)
- Keeps questions with surrounding context
- Adds metadata: `has_question`, `has_process`

Best for FAQ documents, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides.

Example:

```
Text:
"How do you create an agent? First, inherit from AgentBase. Then define your
configuration. Finally, call run() to start the server."

Chunk metadata: {has_question: true, has_process: true}
-> Preserved as single chunk with full context
```

**8. Markdown-Aware**

Chunks at header boundaries, detects code blocks, preserves document structure. See the [Markdown Strategy (Deep Dive)](#markdown-strategy-deep-dive) section below for full details.

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --file-types md
```

Features:

- Chunks at `##` header boundaries
- Never splits code blocks
- Detects programming language in code blocks
- Adds tags: `code`, `code:python`, `code:bash`
- Preserves header hierarchy in metadata

Best for technical documentation with code examples, GitHub README files, API documentation, and developer guides.

**9. JSON (Pre-chunked Content)**

Reads pre-chunked content from JSON files. See the [JSON Manual Curation Workflow](#json-manual-curation-workflow) section below for full details.

```bash
sw-search ./chunks/ \
  --chunking-strategy json \
  --file-types json
```

Best for manually curated knowledge bases, content from APIs that is already structured, and when precise control over chunks is required.

### Choosing the Right Strategy

Decision tree:

```
Do you need code examples to be findable?
+-- Yes -> Use markdown strategy
+-- No
   +-- Is it FAQ/tutorial content?
   |  +-- Yes -> Use qa strategy
   +-- No
      +-- Is it a PDF?
      |  +-- Yes -> Use page strategy
      +-- No
         +-- Need precise control?
         |  +-- Yes -> Use json strategy
         +-- No
            +-- Use sentence strategy (default)
```

#### Strategy Comparison Matrix

| Strategy | Best For | Chunk Size | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------------|------|------|
| sentence | General text | Small | Fast, simple | May split context |
| paragraph | Articles, blogs | Medium | Natural boundaries | Variable size |
| page | Books, papers | Large | Preserves context | May be too large |
| sliding_window | Dense content | Medium | Overlapping context | Duplication |
| semantic | Narrative text | Variable | Topic coherence | Slower |
| topic | Long documents | Variable | Topic-based | Requires NLP |
| qa | FAQ content | Medium | Keeps Q&A together | Needs structure |
| markdown | Technical docs | Variable | Preserves code | Markdown required |
| json | Pre-chunked | Any | Full control | Manual work |

#### Strategy Comparison on Real Content

Original text (API docs):

```markdown
## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. Use your API key in the Authorization header.

### Python Example

import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data", headers=headers)

### Common Errors

Error 401 means invalid credentials. Error 403 means insufficient permissions.
```

**Sentence strategy result:**

- Chunk 1: "All API requests require authentication. Use your API key in the Authorization header."
- Chunk 2: "import requests headers = { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" } response = ..."
- Chunk 3: "Error 401 means invalid credentials. Error 403 means insufficient permissions."

Problem: Code is split from its context.

**Markdown strategy result:**

- Chunk 1 (## Authentication section): Full section including header and description. Metadata: `{h2: "Authentication"}`
- Chunk 2 (### Python Example section): Header + complete code block (unsplit). Metadata: `{h2: "Authentication", h3: "Python Example", has_code: true, tags: ["code", "code:python"]}`
- Chunk 3 (### Common Errors section): Header + error descriptions. Metadata: `{h2: "Authentication", h3: "Common Errors"}`

Code is intact, hierarchical context is preserved, and chunks are searchable by code tag.

### Chunk Size Recommendations

- **Sentence strategy:** 5-8 sentences per chunk
- **Paragraph strategy:** Let natural paragraphs define size
- **Sliding window:** 100-200 words, 20-40 word overlap
- **Markdown strategy:** Let headers define size (naturally varies)

### Markdown Strategy (Deep Dive)

The markdown chunking strategy is specifically designed for technical documentation. Generic chunking strategies (sentence, paragraph) treat documentation as plain text and do not understand code blocks, headers, or section hierarchy.

#### Header-Based Splitting

Headers (`##`, `###`, etc.) mark logical topic changes. The strategy uses them as natural chunk boundaries:

```markdown
## Authentication

Content about authentication...

## Configuration

Content about configuration...
```

This becomes two chunks, each containing the complete section content.

Each chunk knows its place in the document structure:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Authentication

### Bearer Tokens

Content here...
```

The "Bearer Tokens" chunk has full context:
- h1: "API Reference"
- h2: "Authentication"
- h3: "Bearer Tokens"

Best practices for headers:

```markdown
## Topic (h2 for main topics)
### Subtopic (h3 for subtopics)
#### Detail (h4 for details)
```

Avoid skipping levels (e.g., going from `##` directly to `####`).

#### Code Block Preservation

Code blocks are detected and treated as atomic units -- they are never split across chunks.

```markdown
## Example

Here's how to create an agent:

    from signalwire import AgentBase

    class MyAgent(AgentBase):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(name="MyAgent")

This creates a basic agent.
```

This entire section becomes one chunk with the complete code block intact.

Keep code examples under descriptive headers so that code chunks have descriptive headers in their metadata.

Always specify the language in code fences. Without language tags, code chunks miss language-specific metadata and tagging.

#### Language Detection

The strategy extracts the language from code fence syntax (e.g., ` ```python `, ` ```bash `, ` ```javascript `). Each chunk gets language-specific metadata and tags such as `code:python` or `code:javascript`.

These tags enable precise language-specific searches. For example, a query for "javascript example voice" will match chunks tagged `code:javascript` over chunks tagged `code:python`.

#### Hierarchy Metadata

Each chunk automatically receives rich metadata:

```python
{
    "h1": "Getting Started",           # Top-level header
    "h2": "Creating Your First Agent", # Second-level header
    "h3": "Python Example",            # Third-level header
    "has_code": True,                  # Contains code blocks
    "code_languages": ["python"],      # Languages in this chunk
    "tags": ["code", "code:python"],   # Searchable tags
    "depth": 3                         # Header nesting depth
}
```

Code chunks receive special treatment in hybrid search: chunks with code tags receive a 20% boost when keywords match, causing actual code examples to rank higher than prose about code.

**Building with the markdown strategy:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --file-types md \
  --output docs.swsearch
```

**With pgvector:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --backend pgvector \
  --connection-string "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/knowledge" \
  --output signalwire_docs
```

**Limitations:**

- Does not help with non-markdown content
- Poorly structured markdown (missing headers) degrades results
- Code outside fenced blocks (inline code) is treated as plain text
- Documentation that does not use headers will not benefit

For content that lacks headers, consider the JSON workflow for manual structuring.

### JSON Manual Curation Workflow

The JSON workflow provides full manual control over what gets indexed, how it is structured, and what metadata is attached. It is suited for high-value knowledge bases, API documentation from structured sources, content from databases, and cases where quality control requires reviewing every chunk.

#### Two-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: Export chunks to JSON**

Use automatic chunking to generate candidate chunks, then export to JSON for review:

```bash
# Export all chunks to a single JSON file
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --output-format json \
  --output all_chunks.json
```

Or export to separate files (one per source document):

```bash
# Export to directory with one JSON file per source
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --output-format json \
  --output-dir ./chunks/
```

**Phase 2: Build index from JSON**

After reviewing and editing the JSON, build the final index:

```bash
sw-search ./chunks/ \
  --chunking-strategy json \
  --file-types json \
  --output final.swsearch
```

Common edits during review:

- Add descriptive chunk IDs (replace auto-generated `chunk_0`, `chunk_1`)
- Add relevant tags for hybrid search boosting
- Add URLs to source documentation
- Add priority levels (`high`, `normal`, `low`)
- Link related chunks via `related_chunks`
- Remove low-value chunks (e.g., header-only content)
- Merge chunks that are always relevant together

**Combining automatic and manual chunks:**

```bash
# Export critical docs to JSON for curation
sw-search ./docs/critical/ \
  --output-format json \
  --output critical_chunks.json

# Edit critical_chunks.json manually

# Build index from both curated JSON and automatic chunking
sw-search ./critical_chunks.json ./docs/other/ \
  --chunking-strategy json \
  --file-types json,md \
  --output combined.swsearch
```

**Required fields:**

- `chunks` (array): Top-level array containing all chunk objects.
- `content` (string, per chunk): The actual text content. Minimum length: 1 character. Can include markdown formatting.

**All metadata fields are optional.** Custom metadata fields are allowed (`additionalProperties: true`) and are stored and preserved but not used by search unless custom logic is implemented.

**Minimal valid JSON:**

```json
{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "content": "This is a chunk of text."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Standard example:**

```json
{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "content": "To create an agent, inherit from AgentBase and implement your methods...",
      "metadata": {
        "filename": "getting_started.md",
        "section": "Creating Agents",
        "h1": "Getting Started",
        "h2": "Creating Your First Agent",

#### Use Cases (API Docs, Custom Content)

**Scraping API documentation:**

```python
import json
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_api_docs(base_url):
    """Scrape API docs and create structured chunks"""
    chunks = []

    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/api/docs")
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    for endpoint in soup.find_all('div', class_='endpoint'):
        method = endpoint.find('span', class_='method').text

**Programmatic generation (Python):**

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List

class ChunkBuilder:
    """Build JSON chunks programmatically"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.chunks = []

    def add_chunk(
        self,
        content: str,
        tags: List[str] = None,
        category: str = None,
        difficulty: str = None,

        **extra_metadata
    ):

builder.add_chunk(
    content="Getting started with the API...",
    tags=["getting-started", "api"],
    category="documentation",
    difficulty="beginner",
    h1="Getting Started",
    h2="Overview"
)

builder.add_chunk(

    category="documentation",
    difficulty="intermediate",
    has_code=True,
    code_languages=["python"],
    h1="Getting Started",
    h2="Examples"
)

builder.to_json("chunks.json")
```

**Programmatic generation (JavaScript):**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

class ChunkBuilder {
  constructor() {
    this.chunks = [];
  }

  addChunk(content, metadata = {}) {
    this.chunks.push({
      content,
      metadata: {
        created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        ...metadata
      }
    });
  }

  toJSON(outputPath) {
    const data = JSON.stringify({ chunks: this.chunks }, null, 2);
    fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, data);
  }
}

const builder = new ChunkBuilder();

builder.addChunk(
  "Getting started with the API...",
  {
    tags: ["getting-started", "api"],
    category: "documentation",
    difficulty: "beginner",
    h1: "Getting Started",
    h2: "Overview"
  }
);

builder.toJSON("chunks.json");
```

#### Validation

**Using JSON schema validator:**

```python
import json
import jsonschema

with open('chunk_schema.json') as f:
    schema = json.load(f)

with open('chunks.json') as f:
    chunks = json.load(f)

try:
    jsonschema.validate(chunks, schema)
    print("Valid JSON")
except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Invalid: {e.message}")
```

**Basic validation script:**

```python
import json

def validate_chunks(filename):
    """Validate chunk JSON structure"""
    with open(filename) as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    if "chunks" not in data:
        print("ERROR: Missing 'chunks' key")
        return False

    for i, chunk in enumerate(data["chunks"]):
        if "content" not in chunk:
            print(f"ERROR: Chunk {i} missing 'content'")
            return False

        if not chunk["content"].strip():
            print(f"WARNING: Chunk {i} has empty content")

        if "chunk_id" not in chunk:
            print(f"WARNING: Chunk {i} missing 'chunk_id'")

        if "metadata" in chunk:
            if "tags" not in chunk["metadata"]:
                print(f"INFO: Chunk {i} has no tags")

    print(f"Validated {len(data['chunks'])} chunks")
    return True

validate_chunks("api_chunks.json")
```

**Command-line JSON syntax validation:**

```bash
python -m json.tool chunks.json > /dev/null && echo "Valid JSON"
```

**Common validation errors:**

- Missing `content` field (required)
- Empty content string (must be non-empty)
- Invalid `priority` value (must be `critical`, `high`, `normal`, or `low`)
- Invalid `language` code (must match ISO format like `en` or `en-US`)

### Inspecting and Testing Chunks

Export chunks to JSON to review how they are split:

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --chunking-strategy markdown \
  --output-format json \
  --output chunks.json
```

Review `chunks.json` for:

- Chunks that are too small (missing context)
- Chunks that are too large (too much noise)
- Code blocks that are split (indicates wrong strategy)
- Related concepts that are separated

Build test indexes with different strategies and compare:

```bash
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy sentence --output sentence.swsearch
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy markdown --output markdown.swsearch
sw-search ./docs --chunking-strategy qa --output qa.swsearch
```

Then test queries against each:

```bash
sw-search search sentence.swsearch "how to authenticate"
sw-search search markdown.swsearch "how to authenticate"
sw-search search qa.swsearch "how to authenticate"
```

## Embedding Models

The embedding model affects both search quality and performance. The SDK uses the sentence-transformers library and provides three model aliases.

### Available Models (mini, base, large)

| Model | Alias | Full Identifier | Dimensions | Parameters | Size | Speed |
|-------|-------|----------------|------------|------------|------|-------|
| Mini | `mini` | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | 22.7M | ~90MB | Fast |
| Base | `base` | `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` | 768 | 109M | ~420MB | Medium |
| Large | `large` | `sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1` | 1024 | 355M | ~1.4GB | Slow |

```bash
sw-search ./docs --model mini   # Recommended default
sw-search ./docs --model base   # Higher quality
sw-search ./docs --model large  # Highest quality
```

**Mini (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** -- Recommended default

- 6-layer transformer based on Microsoft's MiniLM
- 384-dimensional embeddings
- Embedding speed: ~1,000 chunks/second (CPU), ~5,000 chunks/second (GPU)
- Query embedding: 5-8ms (CPU)
- Runtime memory: ~1GB total (with overhead), ~1.5GB peak
- Best for: production deployments, voice agents (latency-sensitive), large knowledge bases (>50K chunks), FAQ systems, general documentation

**Base (all-mpnet-base-v2)**

- 12-layer transformer based on Microsoft's MPNet
- 768-dimensional embeddings
- Embedding speed: ~500 chunks/second (CPU), ~2,500 chunks/second (GPU)
- Query embedding: 10-15ms (CPU)
- Runtime memory: ~2.5GB total (with overhead)
- Best for: quality-critical applications, complex semantic searches, legal/medical documentation, nuanced language understanding

**Large (all-roberta-large-v1)**

- 24-layer transformer based on Facebook's RoBERTa
- 1024-dimensional embeddings
- Embedding speed: ~200 chunks/second (CPU), ~1,000 chunks/second (GPU)
- Query embedding: 20-30ms (CPU)
- Runtime memory: ~4GB total (with overhead)
- Best for: research projects, specialized domains, offline batch processing. Not recommended for production due to resource requirements.

### Speed vs Quality Tradeoffs

**Accuracy comparison** (1,000 technical documentation queries):

| Model | Precision@5 | Recall@5 | MRR | Avg Similarity |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----|----------------|
| Mini | 0.847 | 0.923 | 0.782 | 0.654 |
| Base | 0.891 | 0.951 | 0.823 | 0.687 |
| Large | 0.903 | 0.959 | 0.841 | 0.701 |

Mini achieves 94% of base model accuracy with 2-3x speed improvement.

**Speed comparison** (building 10,000 chunks on CPU):

| Model | Build Time | Chunks/Second | Index Size |
|-------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Mini | 10 minutes | 1,000 | 40MB |
| Base | 20 minutes | 500 | 80MB |
| Large | 50 minutes | 200 | 120MB |

**Benchmark performance (Semantic Textual Similarity):**

| Model | STS Benchmark | SICK-R | MS MARCO (MRR@10) | TREC-COVID (NDCG@10) |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Mini | 82.41 | 78.23 | 32.3 | 63.2 |
| Base | 86.99 | 84.57 | 35.8 | 69.4 |
| Large | 88.45 | 86.32 | 37.2 | 71.8 |

**Query performance scaling:**

| Chunk Count | Mini | Base |
|-------------|------|------|
| 10,000 | ~8ms | ~18ms |
| 100,000 | ~80ms | ~180ms |
| 1,000,000 | ~800ms | ~1.8s |

**Index build time benchmarks** (1,000 documents, ~20,000 chunks):

| Configuration | Build Time | Index Size |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| mini + sentence | 3 minutes | 30MB |
| mini + markdown | 8 minutes | 80MB |
| base + sentence | 7 minutes | 120MB |
| base + markdown | 15 minutes | 160MB |

**Query latency by backend:**

| Configuration | Latency |
|--------------|---------|
| SQLite + mini | 15-25ms |
| SQLite + base | 25-40ms |
| pgvector + mini | 20-35ms |
| pgvector + base | 35-50ms |

**Memory comparison (runtime):**

| Model | Model Size | Peak Memory | Concurrent Agents (32GB) |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Mini | 90MB | 1.5GB | 16 |
| Base | 420MB | 2.5GB | 10 |
| Large | 1.4GB | 4GB | 6 |

**Cost comparison** (estimated monthly for 1M queries):

| Model | Compute | Memory | Total |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| Mini | $50 | $20 | $70 |
| Base | $100 | $40 | $140 |
| Large | $250 | $80 | $330 |

**When mini is sufficient (most cases):**

- Well-structured documentation with clear headings
- Distinct topics per section
- Code examples (combined with markdown strategy)
- Consistent terminology
- Conversational queries ("how do I install", "show me configuration example")

**When base provides meaningful improvement:**

- Subtle semantic distinctions (e.g., "latency" vs "lag" vs "delay", "authenticate" vs "authorize" vs "validate")
- Domain-specific technical jargon
- Multi-language content requiring cross-lingual similarity
- Very small indexes where speed is not a concern

**Model selection by use case:**

| Use Case | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Voice agents | Mini | Latency critical, 5-8ms query time |
| Chat agents | Mini or Base | Latency less critical |
| FAQ systems | Mini | Queries are straightforward |
| Technical documentation | Mini | Good with structured text + markdown strategy |
| Legal/Medical | Base | Nuance and accuracy critical |
| Research/Academic | Base or Large | Complex language, subtle distinctions |
| Multi-lingual | Base | Better cross-lingual transfer |

### Embedding Dimensions and Storage

Embeddings are vectors -- lists of floating-point numbers representing meaning. Higher dimensions capture more subtle semantic nuances but require more computation and storage.

**Storage requirements per chunk:**

| Model | Calculation | Bytes per Chunk |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Mini | 384 floats x 4 bytes | 1,536 bytes |
| Base | 768 floats x 4 bytes | 3,072 bytes |
| Large | 1024 floats x 4 bytes | 4,096 bytes |

**For 10,000 chunks (vectors only):**

- Mini: ~15MB
- Base: ~30MB
- Large: ~40MB

Total index size is approximately 2-3x the vector storage due to content, metadata, and indexes.

**pgvector column definitions:**

```sql
-- Mini model (384 dimensions)
embedding vector(384)   -- 1,536 bytes per row

-- Base model (768 dimensions)
embedding vector(768)   -- 3,072 bytes per row

-- Large model (1024 dimensions)
embedding vector(1024)  -- 4,096 bytes per row
```

### Custom Models

Any sentence-transformers compatible model from HuggingFace can be used:

```bash
# Multi-lingual model
sw-search ./docs --model sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2

# Instruction-tuned model
sw-search ./docs --model hkunlp/instructor-base

# Domain-specific models
sw-search ./docs --model pritamdeka/S-PubMedBert-MS-MARCO    # Medical
sw-search ./docs --model sentence-transformers/allenai-specter  # Scientific
```

Requirements for custom models:

- Must be available on HuggingFace
- Must be compatible with sentence-transformers (supports `.encode()` method)
- Must output fixed-size embeddings
- Model downloads automatically on first use

**Model download and caching:**

Models are downloaded automatically on first use and cached locally:

- Linux/Mac: `~/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<user>\.cache\torch\sentence_transformers\`

Use `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` environment variable to customize the cache directory. Set `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` to prevent model downloads (offline mode).

**GPU acceleration:**

All models support GPU acceleration with approximately 5x speedup:

```python
import torch
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', device='cuda')
else:
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', device='cpu')
```

GPU VRAM requirements: Mini: 2GB, Base: 4GB, Large: 8GB.

**Hardware recommendations:**

| Model | Development (CPU/RAM/Disk) | Production Single Agent | Production Multiple Agents |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mini | 4+ cores / 8GB / 10GB | 2-4 cores / 4GB / 5GB | 8+ cores / 16GB / 10GB |
| Base | 8+ cores / 16GB / 15GB | 4-8 cores / 8GB / 10GB | 16+ cores / 32GB / 20GB |

### Migrating Between Models

To change models, the index must be rebuilt. Embeddings from different models are not compatible and cannot be converted.

```bash
# Original index (base model)
sw-search ./docs --model base --output docs_base.swsearch

# Switch to mini model -- requires full rebuild
sw-search ./docs --model mini --output docs_mini.swsearch
```

Do not mix models in a single index. Indexes built with one model cannot be searched with a different model due to dimension mismatches (384 vs 768 vs 1024). When searching an existing index, the system automatically detects and uses the model that was used to build it.

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--format FORMAT` | Export format: `json`, `jsonl` | `json` |

**Export all chunks to single file:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --output-format json \
  --output all_chunks.json
```

**Export to separate files (one per source document):**

```bash
sw-search ./docs \
  --output-format json \
  --output-dir ./chunks/
```

Creates one JSON file per source document:

```
chunks/
  docs_getting-started.json
  docs_api-reference.json
  examples_agent.json
```

### Remote Search

```bash
sw-search remote [ENDPOINT] [QUERY] [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `ENDPOINT` -- Search server URL
- `QUERY` -- Search query

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--index-name NAME` | Index to search on remote server | -- |
| `--count N` | Number of results | `5` |
| `--threshold FLOAT` | Similarity threshold | `0.5` |
| `--auth-user USER` | Authentication username | -- |
| `--auth-pass PASS` | Authentication password | -- |

**Basic remote search:**

```bash
sw-search remote http://localhost:8001 "query" --index-name docs
```

**With authentication:**

```bash
sw-search remote http://localhost:8001 "query" \
  --index-name docs \
  --auth-user admin \
  --auth-pass secret
```

Remote search is useful for centralized search services, multiple agents querying the same index, and separating search from agent infrastructure.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SW_SEARCH_MODEL` | Default embedding model | `mini` |
| `SW_SEARCH_OUTPUT` | Default output directory | Current directory |
| `SW_SEARCH_VERBOSE` | Enable verbose output by default (set to `1`) | -- |
| `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` | Directory for cached models | `~/.cache/huggingface/transformers` |
| `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` | Use offline mode, do not download models (set to `1`) | -- |
| `SEARCH_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging for search operations (set to `1`) | -- |
| `PGVECTOR_CONNECTION` | Default PostgreSQL connection string | -- |
| `PGVECTOR_DB_USER` | PostgreSQL username | -- |
| `PGVECTOR_DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | -- |
| `PGVECTOR_HOST` | PostgreSQL host | `localhost` |
| `PGVECTOR_PORT` | PostgreSQL port | `5432` |
| `PGVECTOR_DB_NAME` | PostgreSQL database name | -- |

Example:

```bash
export SW_SEARCH_MODEL=mini
export PGVECTOR_CONNECTION="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/knowledge"
export SW_SEARCH_VERBOSE=1

sw-search ./docs --backend pgvector --output docs
```

### Batch Processing

**Process multiple directories:**

```bash
for dir in docs-v1 docs-v2 docs-v3; do
  sw-search ./$dir --output ${dir}.swsearch
done
```

**Build indexes in parallel:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs1 --output docs1.swsearch &
sw-search ./docs2 --output docs2.swsearch &
sw-search ./docs3 --output docs3.swsearch &
wait
```

**Multi-collection pgvector build:**

```bash
sw-search ./docs/api \
  --backend pgvector \
  --connection-string "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --collection-name api_docs

sw-search ./docs/guides \
  --backend pgvector \
  --connection-string "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --collection-name guides

sw-search ./docs/examples \
  --backend pgvector \
  --connection-string "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --collection-name examples

# Validate each
for collection in api_docs guides examples; do
  sw-search validate \
    --backend pgvector \
    --connection-string "$DATABASE_URL" \
    --collection-name $collection
done
```

**Migration commands:**

```bash
# SQLite to pgvector
sw-search migrate ./knowledge.swsearch \
  --to-pgvector \
  --connection-string "postgresql://localhost/db" \
  --collection-name docs

# pgvector to SQLite
sw-search migrate \
  --from-pgvector \
  --connection-string "postgresql://localhost/db" \
  --collection-name docs \
  --output exported.swsearch

# Get migration info
sw-search migrate --info ./knowledge.swsearch
```

**Performance tuning:**

```bash
# Adjust batch size (lower = less memory, higher = faster)
sw-search ./docs --batch-size 100

# Use multiple CPU cores
sw-search ./docs --workers 4

# Memory-constrained environments
sw-search ./docs \
  --batch-size 16 \
  --workers 1 \
  --model mini
```

**Debugging build issues:**

```bash
# Maximum verbosity
sw-search ./docs --verbose --debug

# Check file discovery without building
sw-search ./docs --verbose --dry-run

# Test on single file
sw-search ./docs/problematic.md --output test.swsearch --verbose

# Build and immediately validate
sw-search ./docs --output test.swsearch && \
sw-search validate test.swsearch
```

### Distance Threshold Guidelines

The `distance_threshold` parameter controls how similar a chunk must be to the query to be included in results. Lower values are stricter; higher values are more permissive.

| Content Type | Recommended Threshold | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Technical documentation | 0.4 | Balanced precision/recall |
| FAQ content | 0.5 | Moderate matching |
| Creative content | 0.6 | Broader matching |
| Exact lookups | 0.3 | Strict matching |
| Code examples | 0.4 | With markdown strategy |
| General knowledge | 0.5 | Permissive |

### Result Count Guidelines

The `count` parameter controls how many results are returned to the LLM.

| Use Case | Recommended Count | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Specific questions | 3 | Focused answer |
| Exploratory questions | 5 | Balanced coverage |
| Research queries | 7-10 | Comprehensive |
| Voice agents | 3 | Concise for speech |
| Chat agents | 5 | Detailed for text |

### Max Content Length

The `max_content_length` parameter limits the total characters returned across all results.

| Agent Type | Recommended Length | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Voice agents | 16384 (16KB) | Faster, focused |
| Chat agents | 32768 (32KB) | Default, balanced |
| Complex queries | 65536 (64KB) | Comprehensive |
| Serverless | 16384 (16KB) | Minimize payload size |
