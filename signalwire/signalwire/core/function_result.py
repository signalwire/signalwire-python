FunctionResult class for handling the response format of SWAIG function calls
"""

from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional, Union


class FunctionResult:
    """
    Wrapper around SWAIG function responses that handles proper formatting
    of response text and actions.
    
    The result object has three main components:
    1. response: Text the AI should say back to the user
    2. action: List of structured actions to execute 
    3. post_process: Whether to let AI take another turn before executing actions
    
    Post-processing behavior:
    - post_process=False (default): Execute actions immediately after AI response
    - post_process=True: Let AI respond to user one more time, then execute actions
    
    This is useful for confirmation workflows like:
    "I'll transfer you to sales. Do you have any other questions first?"
    (AI can handle follow-up, then execute the transfer)
    
    Example:
        return FunctionResult("Found your order")
        
        # With actions
        return (
            FunctionResult("I'll transfer you to support")
            .add_action("transfer", {"dest": "support"})
        )
        
        # With simple action value
        return (
            FunctionResult("I'll confirm that")
            .add_action("confirm", True)
        )
        
        # With multiple actions
        return (
            FunctionResult("Processing your request")
            .add_actions([
                {"set_global_data": {"key": "value"}},
                {"play": {"url": "music.mp3"}}
            ])
        )
        
        # With post-processing enabled
        return (
            FunctionResult("Let me transfer you to billing", post_process=True)
            .connect("+15551234567", final=True)
        )
        
        # Using the connect helper
        return (
            FunctionResult("I'll transfer you to our sales team now")
            .connect("sales@company.com", final=False, from_addr="+15559876543")

        """
        Force the conversation into a specific step in the current context.

        This is a workflow-level transition driven by your webhook, not by the
        model. Webhook-triggered step changes bypass any `valid_steps` clamp
        on the current step (the model's `next_step` tool is the constrained
        path; this is the unconstrained one). Use it when something the user
        said unambiguously requires moving the flow forward.

        Communicating intent to the destination step
        --------------------------------------------
        When the model arrives at the new step, the next thing it sees in
        history is the tool result that contained this action — i.e., your
        FunctionResult's `response` text. Put your "why" there. The model
        reads it before the new step's injected instructions:

            FunctionResult(
                "Premium plan confirmed. Now collecting payment details."
            ).swml_change_step("collect_payment")

        For structured data the destination step needs (account number,
        plan tier, etc.), pair this with `update_global_data()` and reference
        the values from the destination step's `text` via ${var} expansion:

            (FunctionResult("Premium plan confirmed.")
                .update_global_data({"plan": "premium", "billing_cycle": "annual"})
                .swml_change_step("collect_payment"))

        And in the destination step's text:

            step.set_text(
                "Collect payment for the ${plan} plan, billed ${billing_cycle}. "
                "Confirm the amount with the user before proceeding."
            )

        Args:
            step_name: Name of the step to transition to. The step must exist
                in the current context.

        Returns:
            Self for method chaining.

        Example:
            result = (
                FunctionResult("Starting a new hand")
                .update_global_data({"chips": 1000})
                .swml_change_step("betting")
            )
        """

    def swml_change_context(self, context_name: str) -> 'FunctionResult':
        """
        Force the conversation into a different context.

        Webhook-triggered context changes bypass any `valid_contexts` clamp.
        Step state resets (cur_step = 0) on entry. The new context's first
        step's instructions are injected on the next turn.

        Communicating intent to the destination context
        ------------------------------------------------
        Same pattern as swml_change_step: the model reads your FunctionResult's
        `response` text as the tool result before it sees the destination
        context's first step. Put your reason there:

            FunctionResult(
                "I'm transferring you to billing because your question is "
                "about an invoice charge."
            ).swml_change_context("billing")

        For structured carry-over, use update_global_data() and reference the
        values via ${var} expansion in the destination context's step text.

        Note that conversation history is preserved across context switches
        unless the destination context is marked `isolated=True`. The model
        retains everything the user said in the previous context — you do
        not need to re-state it.

            context_name: Name of the context to switch to. Must exist in
