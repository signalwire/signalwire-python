Simple Dynamic Agent Example (New Way)

This example demonstrates the NEW dynamic configuration pattern.
The exact same agent as simple_static_agent.py, but configured dynamically per-request.

This agent does THE SAME THING as the static version:
- Uses a professional voice (inworld.Mark)
- Has a 500ms speech timeout
- Includes helpful hints
- Sets up global data with session info
- Has a customer service focused prompt

BUT... it's configured dynamically, which means:
- We COULD change any setting based on request parameters
- Configuration happens fresh for each request
- Easy to extend with parameter-based customization

Usage:
    python simple_dynamic_agent.py

Available at: http://localhost:3000/

Try these requests:
    curl "http://localhost:3000"
    curl "http://localhost:3000/debug"
    
Compare the SWML output - it will be IDENTICAL to the static version!
