Step Function Inheritance Demo

This example exists to teach one specific gotcha: the per-step `functions`
whitelist INHERITS from the previous step when omitted.

Why this matters
----------------
A common mistake when building multi-step agents is to assume each step
starts with a fresh tool set. It does not. The runtime only resets the
active set when a step explicitly declares its `functions` field. If you
forget set_functions() on a later step, the previous step's tools quietly
remain available.

This file shows three step-shaped patterns side by side:

  1. step_lookup     — explicitly whitelists `lookup_account`
  2. step_inherit    — has NO set_functions() call. Inherits step_lookup's
                       whitelist, so `lookup_account` is still callable here.
                       This is rarely what you want.
  3. step_explicit   — explicitly whitelists `process_payment`. The previous
                       inherited `lookup_account` is now disabled, and only
                       `process_payment` is active.
  4. step_disabled   — explicitly disables ALL user functions with []
                       (or "none"). Internal tools like next_step still work.

Best practice
-------------
Call set_functions() on EVERY step that should differ from the previous
one. Treat omission as an explicit decision to inherit, not a default.

Run this file just to see the rendered SWML — there are no real webhook
endpoints behind the tools, this is purely a documentation example.
