Sigmond Simple - SignalWire Agents SDK Expert (Basic Version)

This agent provides basic information about the SignalWire Agents SDK
without any search tools or external dependencies. All knowledge is
built into the prompt via POM sections.

Features:
- Sigmond's personality from the dual agent app
- Basic SDK information in prompt
- No external dependencies
- Fast startup

To run:
1. Run: python examples/sigmond_simple.py

The agent provides basic SDK guidance without search functionality.
