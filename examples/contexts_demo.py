Advanced Contexts and Steps Demo Agent

This agent demonstrates the complete contexts system including:
- Context entry parameters (system_prompt, consolidate, full_reset, user_prompt)
- Context prompts (structured POM format)
- Step-to-context navigation with context switching
- Multi-persona experience (Franklin, Rachael, Dwight)

## What are Contexts?

Contexts are separate conversation flows within a single agent. Each context can
have its own persona, prompt sections, and available tools. The AI can switch
between contexts using the built-in `change_context` tool. Think of contexts as
different "departments" or "modes" the agent can operate in.

Key context features:
- `set_isolated(True)` — context has its own prompt, independent of other contexts
- `add_section()` — add POM prompt sections specific to this context
- `add_enter_filler()` — spoken phrases when transitioning into this context

## What are Steps?

Steps are sequential stages within a context. Each step has:
- Prompt sections describing what the AI should do at this stage
- `set_step_criteria()` — condition that must be met before advancing
- `set_valid_steps()` — which steps the AI can navigate to from here
- `set_valid_contexts()` — which contexts the AI can switch to from here
- `set_functions()` — restrict which tools are available at this step

The AI automatically gets `next_step` and `change_context` tools to navigate.

## Navigation Control

- `set_valid_steps(["step_name"])` — allow forward navigation to specific steps
- `set_valid_contexts(["context_name"])` — allow switching to specific contexts
- Omitting these means no navigation from that step/context is allowed
